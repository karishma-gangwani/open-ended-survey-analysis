# open-ended-survey-analysis
Hi I have uploaded some scripts for analysis for open ended questions. For a market research perspective these could be comments or concerns from employees, customers or stakeholders involved or directly affected by the project.
for some files I have just done value_counts and converted them to excel to do further analysis and visualization in Tableau or Power BI. Those files have not been added here.
